# magick_dumps

Utility library integrating with the imagemagick runtime
Functionality is in place specifically for providing a way of converting animated images such as gifs and webp to Godot compatible resources at runtime.

Originally created for the sake of providing support for rendering remote content from Twitch's API

## Important

Resources generated by this can end up significantly larger than the source, even with the ZSTD compression that Godot applies to binaries.
This is caused by having to convert all frames to PNGs, a Godot compatible image format with transparency support, which may not have as good compression as the original codec used for the source animation format.

I have personally seen 2mb webp files explode to over 20mb res blobs.  They still load quickly and render accurately, you just have to be aware of space constraints in the target directories that the files are being dumped to.

## Requirements

This has a hard requirement on a binary of imagemagick being installed on the user's system, or provided as an executable with your application.
